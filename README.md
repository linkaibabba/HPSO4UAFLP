# Facility Layout Problem: Optimization Results & Visualization

This repository hosts the **benchmark results** and a **visualization tool** for the Facility Layout Problem (FLP). 

It contains the best layout solutions generated by a private meta-heuristic algorithm, utilizing two different layout representations: **FBS (Flexible Bay Structure)** and **STS (Sequence Triple String)**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```text
FLP-Results-and-Viz/
├── benchmarks/         # Original problem instance files (e.g., raw data)
│
├── results/            # Coordinate text files generated by the algorithm
│   ├── FBS/            # Results using Flexible Bay Structure representation
│   └── STS/            # Results using Sequence Triple String representation
│
├── images/             # Visualized layout diagrams (PNG/JPG)
│   ├── FBS/            # Layout images corresponding to FBS results
│   └── STS/            # Layout images corresponding to STS results
│
